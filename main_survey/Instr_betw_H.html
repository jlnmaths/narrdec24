<p>
    Dear participant,
</p>
<p>
This is the beginning of the second phase of the experiment.</p>
<p>
    In the following, you will again be asked to assess the probability that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?) in the same dataset you just saw.
</p>
<p> You will see the message from phase 1 and another message that points out another pattern in the same dataset.
    You can of course state a different assessment than in phase 1. We also ask you to state the degree of certainty you have in your assessment again.
</p>
<p>
     As a reminder: At the end of the experiment, one of your decisions will be chosen at random and your payoff will be calculated using the formula described at the beginning, such that it is optimal to state your true assessment.
</p>
