<p>
    Dear participants,
</p>
<p>
This is the beginning of the second phase of the experiment.</p>
<p>
    In the following, you will again be asked to make three independent decisions. You will again be confronted with the same datasets.
</p>
<p> For each dataset, you will see the hint from phase 1 and another hint that points out another pattern in the same dataset.
    We again ask for your assessment of the probability that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?). You can of course state a different assessment than in phase 1. We also ask you to state the degree of certainty you have in your assessment after every round again.
</p>
<p>
     As a reminder: At the end of the experiment, one of your decisions across the three phases will be chosen at random and your payoff will be calculated using the formula described at the beginning, such that it is optimal to state your true assessment.
</p>
