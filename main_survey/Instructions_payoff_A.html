    You receive a payoff of between $2.5 and $5 depending on your answers in the experiment.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the question mark (?), there is either a 1 or a 0. Your payoff depends on your assessment of the probability that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?).
   </p>
<p>
    We will choose one of your nine independent decisions across the three phases randomly after you have completed the experiment and calculate your payoff based on this decision. The payoff is calculated in such a way that you receive the maximal expected payoff if you state your true assessment of the probability.

    Details concerning your payoff: Let q be your stated assessment of the probability that a 1 is hidden behind the question mark (?). After you have stated q, the true value behind the question mark (?) is used to determine your payoff. Should there in fact be a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?), you receive a payoff of $5 with a probability of 1-(1-q)*(1-q) and a payoff of $2.5 otherwise. Should there be a 0 hiding instead, you receive $5 with a probability of 1-q*q and $2.5 otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we will ask you to state how certain you are that your assessment is correct.
