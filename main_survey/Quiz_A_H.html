  In this experiment you see datasets and make decisions based on these. The experiment has two phases, you will now receive the instructions for the first phase; the instructions for the second phase will be displayed after you have completed phase 1.
  In the first phase, you make six independent decisions, and another six in the second phase. Independent means that you cannot infer from one decision round to the other.
</p>
<h4>
  Tables
</h4>
<p>
  The datasets are presented in tables, see the example displayed below. The tables consist of 9 rows and 4 columns, see the example table below. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. In the first column you see 8 entries of the main observation (Y); in columns 2 to 4 you see 9 entries for each of the three side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
  In the 9th row the main observation (Y) is missing but you can see the side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
</p>
<p>
  Each row represents observations that were made simultaneously.
  Please note that there is no temporal relationship between the different rows. It is therefore not true that the events that have led to the entries in the first row have necessarily happened before the events that have led to the entries in the 9th row.
</p>
<p>
  There may or may not be a causal relationship between the main and the three side observations. Whether causal or not, the relationship between the observations is the same in each row.

    <h4>Your task</h4>
Your task is to assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). During the task you see the data table. In addition to this, you see a hint, which points out a possible relation in the data. This hint can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?).
</p>
<p>
<h4>Hints</h4>
The hints can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?).
The hints point out a possible relation between main and the side observations. This can be the true relationship, but it is not necessarily so.
For instance, the fact that the main observation (Y) is only 1 if the side observation E2 is also 1 in the visible part of the dataset could be because the main observation depends on the side observation E2. But it could also be due to chance.
For each of the datasets, you are presented with a single hint.
</p>
<p>
    You receive a payoff of between $2.75 and $5.5 depending on your answers in the experiment.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the question mark (?), there is either a 1 or a 0. Your payoff depends on your assessment of the probability that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?).
   </p>
<p>
    We will choose one of your twelve independent decisions across phase 1 and phase 2 randomly after you have completed the experiment and calculate your payoff based on this decision. The payoff is calculated in such a way that you receive the maximal expected payoff if you state your true assessment of the probability.

<p id="hid" class="hidden">
    Details concerning your payoff: Let q be your stated assessment of the probability that a 1 is hidden behind the question mark (?). After you have stated q, the true value behind the question mark (?) is used to determine your payoff. Should there in fact be a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?), you receive a payoff of $5.5 with a probability of 1-(1-q)*(1-q) and a payoff of $2.75 otherwise. Should there be a 0 hiding instead, you receive $5.5 with a probability of 1-q*q and $2.75 otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we will ask you to state how certain you are that your assessment is correct.
