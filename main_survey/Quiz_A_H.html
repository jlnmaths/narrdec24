  In this experiment you see a dataset and make decisions based on the data. The experiment has two phases, you will now receive the instructions for the first phase; the instructions for the second will be displayed before its start.
  You make one decisions in each phase.
</p>
<h4>
  Tables
</h4>
<p>
  The dataset is presented in tables, like in the example displayed below. The table consist of 9 rows and 4 columns. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. In the first column you see 8 entries of the main observation (Y); in columns 2 to 4 you see 9 entries for each of the three side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
  In the 9th row the main observation (Y) is missing but you can see the side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
</p>
<p>
  Each row represents observations that were made simultaneously.
  Please note that there is no temporal relationship between the different rows. It is therefore not true that the events that have led to the entries in the first row have necessarily happened before the events that have led to the entries in the 9th row.
</p>
<p>
  There may or may not be a causal relationship between the main and the three side observations. Whether causal or not, the relationship between the observations is the same in each row.
</p>

    <h4>Your task</h4>
Your task is to assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). During the task you see the data table. In addition to this, you see a message, which points out a possible relation in the data.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Messages</h4>
The messages point out possible patterns in the visible dataset. This could be indicative of how the number behind the question mark (?) was generated, but it is not necessarily so.
For instance, the fact that the main observation (Y) is only 1 if the side observation E2 is also 1 in the visible part of the dataset could be because the main observation depends on the side observation E2. But it could also be due to chance.
</p>
            <h4>Payoff</h4>
            <p>
    You receive a payoff of between $2.5 and $5 depending on your answers in the experiment.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the question mark (?), there is either a 1 or a 0. Your payoff depends on your assessment of the probability that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?).
   </p>
<p>
    We will choose one of your independent decisions randomly after you have completed the experiment and calculate your payoff based on this decision. The payoff is calculated in such a way that you receive the maximal expected payoff if you state your true assessment of the probability.
</p>
<p>
    <button  id="btn" type="button" onclick="toggleDataVisibility()">Show technical details regarding the payoff calculation.</button>
</p>
<p id="hid" class="hidden">
    Details concerning your payoff: Let q be your stated assessment of the probability that a 1 is hidden behind the question mark (?). After you have stated q, the true value behind the question mark (?) is used to determine your payoff. Should there in fact be a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?), you receive a payoff of $5 with a probability of 1-(1-q)*(1-q) and a payoff of $2.5 otherwise. Should there be a 0 hiding instead, you receive $5 with a probability of 1-q*q and $2.5 otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we will ask you to state how certain you are that your assessment is correct.
