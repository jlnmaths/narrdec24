<p>
  In this experiment you see datasets and make decisions based on these. The experiment has two phases, you will now receive the instructions for the first phase; the instructions for the second phase will be displayed after you have completed phase 1.
  In the first phase, you make six independent decisions, and another six in the second phase. Independent means that you cannot infer from one decision round to the other.
</p>
  <h4>Datasets</h4>
<p>
The datasets are presented in tables, see the example displayed below. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. In the first column you see 8 entries of the main observation (Y); in columns 2 to 4 you see 9 entries for each of the three side observations (E1, E2, and E3). Each row represents observations that were made simultaneously. Please note that there is no temporal relationship between the individual rows. It is therefore not true that the events that have led to the entries in the first row have necessarily happened before the entries in the 9th row. In the 9th row the main observation (Y) is missing but you can see the side observations (E1, E2, and E3). There can be a causal relationship between the main and the side observations, but this doesn't have to be the case. Whether causal or not, the relationship between the observations is the same in each row.

    <h4>Your task</h4>
Your task is to assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). During the task you see the data table. In addition to this, you see a hint, which points out a possible relation in the data. This hint can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?).

<h4>Hints</h4>
The hints can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?).
The hints point out a possible relation between main and the side observations. This can be the true relationship, but it is not necessarily so.
For instance, the fact that the main observation (Y) is only 1 if the side observation E2 is also 1 could be because the main observation depends on the side observation E2. But it could also be due to chance. 
For each of the datasets, you are presented with a single hint.
