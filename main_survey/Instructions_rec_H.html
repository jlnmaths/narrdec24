<p>
  In this experiment you see a dataset and make decisions based on these. The experiment has two phases, you will now receive the instructions for the first phase; the instructions for the second will be displayed before its start.
  You make one decisions in each phase.
</p>
<h4>
  Tables
</h4>
<p>
  The dataset is presented in tables, like in the example displayed below. The table consist of 9 rows and 4 columns. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. In the first column you see 8 entries of the main observation (Y); in columns 2 to 4 you see 9 entries for each of the three side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
  In the 9th row the main observation (Y) is missing but you can see the side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
</p>
<p>
  Each row represents observations that were made simultaneously.
  Please note that there is no temporal relationship between the different rows. It is therefore not true that the events that have led to the entries in the first row have necessarily happened before the events that have led to the entries in the 9th row.
</p>
<p>
  There may or may not be a causal relationship between the main and the three side observations. Whether causal or not, the relationship between the observations is the same in each row.

    <h4>Your task</h4>
Your task is to assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). During the task you see the data table. In addition to this, you see a message, which points out a possible relation in the data.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Messages</h4>
The messages point out a possible relation between main and the side observations. This could be indicative of how the number behind the question mark (?) was generated, but it is not necessarily so.
For instance, the fact that the main observation (Y) is only 1 if the side observation E2 is also 1 in the visible part of the dataset could be because the main observation depends on the side observation E2. But it could also be due to chance.
