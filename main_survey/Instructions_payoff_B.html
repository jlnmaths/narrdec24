<p>
    There is either a 1 or a 0 behind the question mark (?). We will choose one of your independent decisions randomly after you have completed the experiment and calculate your payoff based on this decision round.
</p>
<p>
    Your payoff depends either on whether there is a 1 behind the question mark (‘lottery group’) or on your assessment of the probability that a 1 is hidden behind the question mark (‘assessment group’). Whether you are in the lottery group or in the assessment group will be determined randomly and with equal probability.
</p>
<p>
    If you are in the lottery group, you obtain $5 if there is a 1 behind the question mark (?) and $2.5 if there is a 0 behind the question mark (?).
</p>
<p>
    If you are in the assessment group, your payoff depends on your assessment. Your payoff is between $2.5 and $5 and is calculated in such a way that you receive the maximal expected payoff if you state your true assessment of the probability.

        Details concerning your payoff:
    </p>
<p>
If you are randomly assigned to the lottery group, you obtain $5 if there is a 1 behind the question mark (?) and $2.5 if there is a 0 behind the question mark (?).
</p>
<p>
 If you are assigned to the assessment group instead, your payoff is calculated according to the following rule: Let q be your stated assessment of the probability that a 1 is hidden behind the question mark (?). After you have stated q, the true value behind the question mark (?) is used to determine your payoff. Should there in fact be a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?), you receive a payoff of $5 with a probability of 1-(1-q)*(1-q) and a payoff of $2.5 otherwise. Should there be a 0 hiding instead, you receive $5 with a probability of 1-q*q and $2.5 otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we will ask you after every round to state how certain you are that your assessment is correct.
