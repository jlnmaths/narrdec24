<p>
  In this experiment you see datasets and make decisions based on these. You will make three independent decisions. By independent, we mean that you cannot make inferences from one decision to another.
</p>
<h4>
  Tables
</h4>
<p>
  The datasets are presented in tables, see the example displayed below. The tables consist of 9 rows and 4 columns. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. In the first column you see 8 entries of the main observation (Y); in columns 2 to 4 you see 9 entries for each of the three side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
  In the 9th row the main observation (Y) is missing, but you can see the side observations (E1, E2, and E3).
</p>
<p>
  Each row represents observations that were made simultaneously.
  Please note that there is no temporal relationship between the different rows. It is therefore not true that the events that have led to the entries in the first row have necessarily happened before the events that have led to the entries in the 9th row.
</p>
<p>
  There may or may not be a causal relationship between the main and the three side observations. Whether causal or not, the relationship between the observations is the same in each row.

    <h4>Your task</h4>
    Your task is to assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 hidden behind the question mark (?). During the task you see the data table. In addition to this, you have the opportunity to reveal a message from another participant or a signal about the number behind the question mark (described in detail below). You can choose at most one of these options, and if you do, you will have to solve a Captcha (like at the start of this experiment). You do not have to choose either.
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we ask you to state the degree of certainty you have in your assessment after every round.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Messages</h4>
A message is a short text from another participant who also assessed the probability that there is a 1 behind the question mark (?) in the dataset that is presented to you. You can choose between three different messages.
Each message points out a pattern in the visible dataset and thus may be helpful to you in interpreting the dataset. Note, however, that the other participant did not have more information about the number behind the question mark (?) than you.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Signals</h4>
The signal can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?). If you choose to reveal the signal in one of the following rounds, you will see either a red ball or a blue ball. If the ball is red, this means that the number behind the question mark (?) is more likely a 0 than a 1. If the ball is blue, the number behind the question mark (?) is more likely a 1 than a 0.
The signal is generated as follows: There are two urns like in the figure below. Urn Zero contains {{ compl }} blue balls and {{ acc }} red balls, and Urn One contains {{ acc }} blue balls and {{ compl }} red balls. If the number behind the question mark (?) is a 0, a ball is drawn from Urn Zero. Otherwise, a ball is drawn from the Urn One.
