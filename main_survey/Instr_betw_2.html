<p>
    Dear participants,
</p>
<p>
    This is the beginning of the third phase of the experiment.
</p>
<p>
    In the following, you will again be asked to make three independent decisions. <b>You will be confronted with new datasets. </b>
</p>
<p>
    This time, however, you have the opportunity to reveal additional hints or an informative signal about the number behind the question mark (described in detail below). You can choose at most one of these options for the small cost of solving a Captcha (like at the start of this experiment), and you do not have to choose either. You can of course state a different assessment than in phase 1.
    In addition to your assessment of the probability, we again ask you to state the degree of certainty you have in your assessment after every round.
</p>
<p>
     Reminder: At the end of the experiment, one of your decisions from the three phases will be chosen at random and your payoff will be calculated using the formula described at the beginning, such that it is always optimal to state your true assessment.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Signals</h4>
The signals can help you assess whether there is a 0 or a 1 behind the question mark (?). If you choose to reveal the signal in one of the following rounds, you will see either a red ball or a blue ball. If the ball is red, this means that the number behind the question mark (?) is more likely a 0 than a 1. If the ball is blue, the number behind the question mark (?) is more likely a 1 than a 0.
The signal is generated as follows: There are two urns. Urn zero contains {{ acc }} blue balls and {{ compl }} red balls, and urn one contains {{ compl }} blue balls and {{ acc }} red balls. If the number behind the question mark (?) is a 0, a ball is drawn from the red urn. Otherwise, a ball is drawn from the blue urn.
